# Club-Website
The club website for Orono Coding Club.

General etiquette(written by Zack, make edits if necessary and I'm just trying to make sure nobody deletes anyones stuff)

- Try to use pull requests if you're editing someone else's page or making a big change to the main one
  - Try to use descriptive titles
  - Add extra information
  - If it's a tiny pr you should probably just merge it
